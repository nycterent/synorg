# Documentation TODO — organise by Diátaxis

Framework: <https://diataxis.fr/>. Four modes on two axes (action↔cognition,
acquisition↔application). Every doc serves exactly one; the top defect is a page
serving two at once. Work in small closed increments — pick one page, move it to
its mode, commit. Don't gate value on a full reorg.

## Where each mode lives (target)

| Mode | Serves | Home | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tutorial** — learning, guided lesson | a newcomer acquiring the craft | `docs/tutorials/` | **missing — highest-value gap** |
| **How-to** — a goal, competent worker | an operator with a task | `runbooks/` | strong, already how-to shaped |
| **Reference** — information | someone looking a fact up | `docs/reference/` + chart/schema files | strong but scattered |
| **Explanation** — understanding, why | someone building a mental model | `docs/explanation/` | **missing — trapped in the plan** |

## Current inventory → mode audit

**Already correct (leave, or just relocate):**
- `runbooks/{capacity-carve,node-scrub,gpu-node-quarantine,training-onboarding,game-day,service-migration}.md` — how-to. Keep. (One flagged thin on executable commands: `service-migration.md` steps 5-7 — see residual findings.)
- `docs/conventions.md`, `charts/*/README.md`, `charts/*/values.schema.json`, `docs/slo-catalog.md`, `docs/agent-interface.md`, `docs/env-spec-retirement.md`, `docs/ecs-retirement.md` — reference. Keep; consider gathering the loose `docs/*.md` reference files under `docs/reference/`.
- `docs/plans/*`, `docs/residual-review-findings/*` — neither user-docs nor Diátaxis modes; they are decision/record artifacts. Leave out of the docs tree.

**Mis-moded — split or move:**
- `docs/capability-tiers.md` — fuses reference (the tier→mechanism table) with explanation (why blast-radius drives the split). Split: table stays reference; the "why tiers" prose moves to `docs/explanation/capability-model.md`.
- `docs/region-set.md` — fuses reference (the region-set predicate) with explanation (why data-gravity ∧ residency ∧ availability). Split likewise.

## Actions (each a standalone increment)

- [ ] **T1 — Tutorial: "Validate the platform on your laptop in 5 minutes."** `docs/tutorials/first-validation.md`. A guided lesson (fixed path, every step succeeds, author owns the goal): clone, install helm/kubeconform/kyverno, `make demo`, then `make validate`, ending at "you just saw the policy plane reject an unsafe pod." NOT a how-to — no choices, no digressions. `make demo` (scripts/demo.sh) is the spine.
- [ ] **T2 — Tutorial: "Add your first service."** `docs/tutorials/add-a-service.md`. Copy `example-inference.yaml`, edit values, `make validate`, watch it fail on a bad key, fix it. Teaches the values-are-the-interface idea by doing.
- [ ] **E1 — Explanation: the double-pay problem and the lending model.** `docs/explanation/why-lending.md`. Extract from the plan's Problem Frame + Contradiction Analysis (TRIZ) — why hold GPUs, why separation in time/space/discard-recover. Discussion, no steps.
- [ ] **E2 — Explanation: why serving is never Kueue-admitted.** `docs/explanation/reclaim-model.md`. From KTD6 + the ARIZ layered-reclaim resolution: borrowingLimit curve (planned) vs PriorityClass preemption (emergency). This is the most-misunderstood design point — worth a standalone why.
- [ ] **E3 — Explanation: the capability-tier model.** `docs/explanation/capability-model.md`. The "why blast radius decides autonomy" half of capability-tiers.md.
- [ ] **R1 — Reference tidy.** Gather loose `docs/*.md` reference under `docs/reference/`; leave a landing page (below) pointing at them. Mechanical move, no rewrite.
- [ ] **L1 — Docs landing page.** `docs/README.md` routing readers by need: "Learning → tutorials/  ·  Have a task → runbooks/  ·  Look something up → reference/  ·  Understand why → explanation/." One sentence per link.
- [ ] **X1 — Cross-link.** From each explanation, link to the runbook that applies it and the reference that pins its names; from tutorials, link onward to the how-to for real work. Modes stay separate but connected.

## Guardrails

- Author for the human, not the grid — if a split would hurt the reader, look again (usually two fused things), but don't mutilate a good page to satisfy the scheme.
- Tutorial must not explain, offer choices, or chase completeness. How-to must not teach. Reference must not instruct or opine. Explanation must not give steps.
- Prefer moving content to rewriting — mis-moded content is usually the right content in the wrong place.
